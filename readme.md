# Dev notes

- Config format could be better (suboptimal Json parsing)
- For linear symbols win condition, it feels as if 'group' and 'when' values where inverted in the example
- 'covered areas' unused?
- Non-square matrixes allowed but should disable diagonal wins
- Add custom exceptions
- Review carefully evaluation loop for optimisation opportunities
- Do unit tests, start with grid eval
